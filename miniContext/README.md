# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Context API Project

## Features

- **State Management**: Centralized state management using React's Context API.
- **Component Communication**: Seamless data sharing between components without prop drilling.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time data updates and state synchronization across the application.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized component rendering and state handling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
